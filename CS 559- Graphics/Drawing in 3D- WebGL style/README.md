# Description
You will create an interactive visualization of a 3D model using WebGL and GLSL shaders. In principle, you will re-create the experience that was asked of you in Program 4, but instead of doing the drawing using the (2D) routines of the HTML5 canvas, you will leverage the WebGL API and provide your own shaders to accomplish that goal. Some of the challenges that Program 4 was based on will not apply in this case (e.g. visibility will be handled using the Z-buffer, not your explicit implementation of painterâ€™s algorithm), while new concepts related to how WebGL works will now require your attention (e.g. interfacing the WebGL context with your custom shaders, communicating attributes and uniforms to your shaders from the JavaScript code, organizing your geometry data into buffers, etc.)
